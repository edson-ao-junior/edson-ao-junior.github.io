I am **Edson OliveiraJr**, Associate Professor of Software Engineering at the **State University of Maringá (UEM), Maringá-PR, Brazil**.

My research lies at the intersection of **Empirical Software Engineering**, **Open Science**, **Reproducibility**, and **Digital Forensics Experimentation**. I focus on the design, execution, and evaluation of **controlled experiments and quasi-experiments**, as well as on the definition of **research artifacts, metadata, conceptual models, and ontologies** that support transparency, rigor, and long-term reusability of empirical studies.

A central theme of my work is understanding how **open, reproducible, and transparency** can strengthen the reliability of scientific evidence and improve research practices in Software Engineering and Digital Forensics.

On this website, you can find information about my **publications**, **research projects**, **teaching activities**, and **open science**.
