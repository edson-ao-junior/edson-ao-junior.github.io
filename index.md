I am **Edson OliveiraJr**, Associate Professor of Software Engineering at the **State University of Maringá (UEM), Brazil**.

My research focuses on **Empirical Software Engineering**, **Open Science**, **Reproducibility**, and **Digital Forensics Experimentation**, with emphasis on controlled and quasi-experiments, research artifacts, conceptual modeling, ontologies, and metadada standards.

I am particularly interested in how **open and reproducible experimentation** can improve the reliability, transparency, and reuse of scientific evidence in Software Engineering and Digital Forensics.

This website presents my **publications**, **projects**, **teaching activities**, and **open science outputs**.
