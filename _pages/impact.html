<h2>Purpose of This Website</h2>

<p>
This website is designed to support transparency, accessibility, and reuse of academic outputs,
including publications, books, research projects, supervision activities, and educational
materials in Software Engineering and related areas.
</p>

<p>
It also serves as an entry point for international collaboration, student supervision,
and community engagement around empirical software engineering, experimentation,
open science, and digital forensics.

<h2>Website Usage Overview</h2>

<p>
Aggregated access statistics are collected using Google Analytics 4 (GA4) with IP anonymization
enabled. These metrics are used exclusively to understand overall usage patterns and geographic
reach of the website.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Page views and visits over time</li>
  <li>Most accessed sections (e.g., Publications, Supervisions, Books)</li>
  <li>Geographic distribution of visitors (by country)</li>
  <li>Traffic sources (search engines, academic platforms, direct access)</li>
</ul>

<p>
No individual user tracking, profiling, or advertising-related data collection is performed.
</p>

<h2>Use in Academic Reporting</h2>

<p>
The aggregated metrics collected through this website may be used as complementary evidence in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Graduate program evaluation and reporting (e.g., CAPES)</li>
  <li>Research funding accountability and impact descriptions</li>
  <li>Sabbatical and postdoctoral applications</li>
  <li>Institutional visibility and outreach reports</li>
</ul>

<p>
These indicators are not intended to replace traditional academic impact measures (such as
citations), but rather to complement them by illustrating access and dissemination.
