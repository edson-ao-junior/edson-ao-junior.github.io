<p>
My academic background is grounded in Computer Science, with a strong emphasis on Software Engineering,
empirical research methods, and experimentation. My formal education spans undergraduate, master's,
and doctoral training, complemented by postdoctoral research, with consistent support from national
research funding agencies.
