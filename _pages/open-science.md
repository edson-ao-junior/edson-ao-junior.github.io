My research follows **Open Science principles**, emphasizing transparency, reproducibility, and long-term reuse of research outputs.

### Practices
- Open access publications whenever possible
- Public availability of datasets, source code, and experimental protocols
- Use of persistent identifiers and standardized metadata

### Repositories
- **GitHub** – source code and scripts
- **Zenodo** – datasets and archived artifacts
- **OSF** – experimental packages and workflows
- **Software Heritage** – long-term preservation of software artifacts

### Alignment
My work aligns with international recommendations, including the **UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science** and **FAIR data principles**.
