I am **Edson OliveiraJr**, Associate Professor of Software Engineering at the **State University of Maringá (UEM), Maringá-PR, Brazil**, where I am affiliated with undergraduate and graduate programs in Computer Science.

My research agenda is centered on **Empirical Software Engineering**, with strong connections to **Open Science**, **Reproducibility**, and **Digital Forensics Experimentation**. I investigate how empirical methods, particularly **controlled experiments and quasi-experiments** can be systematically designed, executed, documented, and evaluated to improve the rigor, reliability and transparency of scientific evidence.

A significant part of my work focuses on **research artifacts and metadata**, including experimental protocols, datasets, analysis scripts, conceptual models, and ontologies. I am especially interested in how **metadata standards, ontologies, and provenance models** can support experiment reproducibility, auditability, and long-term reuse across Software Engineering and Digital Forensics research.

More recently, my research has explored the notion of **forensic-ready experimentation**, examining how experimental processes and artifacts can be structured to support traceability, accountability, and post hoc analysis in complex computational studies.

In addition to research, I have extensive experience in **teaching Software Engineering and empirical methods**, supervising undergraduate and graduate students, and contributing to academic service activities such as program committees, reviewing, and community-driven open science initiatives.

This website serves as a hub for my **publications**, **research projects**, **teaching materials**, and **open science**, aiming to promote transparency, collaboration, and reuse.
