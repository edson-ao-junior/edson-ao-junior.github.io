In addition to my research and teaching activities, I have held several academic leadership and
service roles at the State University of Maringá (UEM), as well as national-level academic service
appointments in Brazil. These roles reflect my sustained involvement in undergraduate and graduate
program management, curriculum development, institutional governance, the coordination of open
science initiatives within the graduate program, and the evaluation of research and graduate
education policies at institutional, state, and national levels.
